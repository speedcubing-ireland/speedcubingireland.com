### [Live Results](/redirects/wca-live)
Live results are availible at [WCA Live](/redirects/wca-live). Please note that there is some delay as results get entered into the system manually throughout the day. If you find any inconsistancies, please contact the competition staff.

### [Live Groups](/redirects/comp-groups)
Live groups and assignments are availible at [Competition Groups](/redirects/comp-groups). This will show you when you are supposed to compete, run, judge, and scramble.
